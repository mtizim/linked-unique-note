# Linked unique note

An obsidian plugin for folders containing timestamped notes. You can:

-   create a new note that automatically links itself to the newest timestamped note (and links the note to the newly created one)
-   jump to the newest timestamped note
-   automatically link all timestamped notes in a folder (requires a small change in the code, it is quite dangerous as a mass operation)

Example link structure:

<span style="display: block;text-align: left;">←[[2022-09-01 at 21ː13]]</span> <span style="display: block;text-align: right;">[[2022-09-12 at 20ː01]]→</span>
